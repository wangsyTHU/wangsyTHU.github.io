I am now a Schmidt AI in Science Postdoctoral Associate at Cornell University in [PEESE research group](https://www.peese.org/), led by [Prof. Fengqi You](https://www.peese.org/professor/). Previously, I was an Ezra Postdoctoral Associate in Energy Systems at Cornell University. I obtained my Ph.D. degree from the [Department of Electrical Engineering](https://www.eea.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/index.htm) at Tsinghua University, supervised by [Prof. Wenchuan Wu](https://www.eea.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/faculties/wuwench.htm), and I was a member of the [EMS R&D Team](https://www.eea.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/info/1009/1780.htm) led by [Prof. Hongbin Sun](https://www.eea.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/faculties/shb.htm).

My research focuses on improving and applying AI and optimization to enhance the secure and efficient operation of energy systems in the transition to a low-carbon future. My work includes quantifying the flexibility of distributed energy resources (DERs) and integrated energy systems (IESs), improving renewable generation forecasting, and analyzing the implications of energy and climate policies.
